			<p class="bold">People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs. The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration. Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity. Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection. The WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID‑19. Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.</p><br>

				<div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12"><p2>Per the World Health Organization, as of April 2020, <u>there is no specific treatment for COVID‑19.</u> On 1 May 2020, the United States gave emergency use authorization (not full approval) for remdesivir in people hospitalized with severe COVID‑19 after a study suggested it reduced the duration of recovery. Researchers continue working on more effective treatments and many vaccine candidates are in development or testing phases.<br><br>For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend <b>paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen</b> for first-line use. The WHO and NIH do not oppose the use of <b>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</b> such as ibuprofen for symptoms, and the FDA says currently there is no evidence that NSAIDs worsen COVID‑19 symptoms.While theoretical concerns have been raised about ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, as of 19 March 2020, these are not sufficient to justify stopping these medications. One study from 22 April found that <u>people with COVID‑19 and hypertension had lower all-cause mortality when on these medications.</u> Steroids, such as methylprednisolone, are not recommended unless the disease is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p2></div>

			<div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12">
			<h2><u>Protective Equipment:</u></h2>
			<p1>Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation. For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID‑19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an <b>Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR)</b> in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.<br><br> The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of <b>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</b> during the pandemic. The recommended gear is a <u>PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.</u> When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred. <b>N95 respirators</b> are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses. When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.</p1><br><br><br></div>

			<h2><u>Mechanical Ventilation:</u></h2>
			<p3>Most cases of COVID‑19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are. The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID‑19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in the hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure. Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known. Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.<br><br>Mechanical ventilation had been performed in <b>79% of critically ill people in hospital including 62% who previously received other treatment.</b> Of these 41% died, according to one study in the United States. <b>Severe cases are most common in older adults</b> <u>(those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).</u> Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID‑19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation. This limited capacity is a significant driver behind calls to flatten the curve. One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died. In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID‑19 are eventually admitted to ICU.</p3><br><br><br>
			<h2><u>Accute Respiratory Distress Syndrome:</u></h2>
			<p>Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as <b>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</b> develops in COVID‑19 and <b>oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.</b> Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.<u> High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.</u> There is high mortality in people ventilated with COVID-19, thought to be due to cytokine storm. Blockade of the IL-6 system is recommended by Australasian Society for Immunology and Allergy to be considered early in severe disease, and is included for consideration in a number of national guidelines</p><br>
			<h2><u>Experimental Treatment:</u></h2>
			<p2>Research into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.<b> Remdesivir</b> appears to be the most promising. Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop, several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing. Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease. The WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened. It has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.</p2>
